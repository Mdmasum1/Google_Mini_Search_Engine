== By the end of the week 1:
--1. Inverted index with skip pointers
--2. Boolean queries(AND, OR, NOT)
--3. Index 1000 + documents
--4.Query response less < 50 ms
--5. Save/load from the disk
--6. Basic command line interface

=====================================

COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID:

1. Don't overcomplicate: Start with simple tokenization

2. Test with small data first: 100 documents, not 1 million

3. Write tests from day 1: pytest tests/

4 Profile early: Find bottlenecks before scaling

5. Document your code: You'll thank yourself later
